Simple, client-side blog for you and your cat.

AngularBlog is the software for people who wants to run their site without any backend. Everything is made with AngularJS from the ground up. This means that blog posts are in raw html, themes written in html, css and javascript ONLY. It's highly customisable for everyone that knows HTML, CSS and a bit of JavaScript.
